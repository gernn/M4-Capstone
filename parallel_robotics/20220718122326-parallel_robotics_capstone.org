* Applications

** Why would you even want to do this?

- Two classes of robots

*** serial (like an arm)

- positioning error is cumumlative
- long, complex chain structures
- rigidity decreases as chain count increases
- joint flexibility dependent on upstream and downstream joints

*** parallel (like a spider)

- each chain relatively short and simple in structure
- resists unnecessary movement
- chain positioning error is average
- off-axis flexibility of joints also affected by other chains
- provides closed-loop stiffness, robot is rigid relative to components
- rigidity increases as chain count increases

** Who even does this?

Anyone who needs really high precision, has comparably small manipulated objects, and is okay with one location


*** Warehousing

*** Pick + Place + small object manip

Easier + More precise control important/cheaper for small items

*** Motion simulator people

Easier to calculate a specific path in parallel kinematics

*** Biomedical people

Just trust me on this one, assaying, test verification, DNA sequencing, all automatable with parallel robotics. Bio people tend not to call it robotics though.

*** TODO REMOVE friendly university students

* Mechanical Modules

** Frame (8020)

[[https://8020.net/20-2020.html][site]], $0.25/inch


*** an object

*** an assembly

** Effector

Popular to 3d print these for passive end manipulator, probably looking at small sheetmetal project for active manipulator

*** CoGiRo (passive)

** Winches + Pulleys (they rotate)

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400
[[file:Hardware_needed/2022-07-18_13-16-45_screenshot.png]]

- Probably looks something like that
  - stepper motor (bottom)
  - gearing + screw (right)
  - optical encoder + PCBA for closed loop control (left)
  - pulley (top)
  - this is the mechanically challenging bit

** Stepper Motors

Tricky to buy these guys, they tend to be expensive per unit on Digikey and I'd need to do ~1 day of research into the minimum viable motor

** Mounts

Mounting on 8020 is super easy, literally like legos

* Electronics Modules

** Effector Controller

- small PCBA for actuating whatever is on the effector
- communication is possible by a trailing cable assembly or wireless
  - cable for something requiring significant power
  - wireless for low power application

** Generic Rotary Encoder

- You can buy these on Digikey
- usually easy to interface them with your custom hardware (SPI/CAN/etc)

[[file:Electronics_Modules/2022-07-18_13-48-01_screenshot.png]]

** Generic Stepper Motor Driver

- You can buy these on Digikey
- Piece of hardware that generates and sends signals to our selected stepper motor

** Main Control Board
handles:
- pathing and kinematics
- calibration (likely by limit switch?)
- rotary encoder info streams
- connection to effector
- any fancy active controls we want to implement (like robotic vision)
probably needs to be specced for running some ROS modules, MSP432 dev boards run $50/piece, beaglebone black SBC, or EMC32 line are also good choices

** Power Supply Unit
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 200
[[file:Power_Supply_Unit/2022-07-18_14-27-16_screenshot.png]]
Hard to size until you know what stepper motors are drawing, what your central board is specced for, if you want to do any advanced + special control gizmos. Fermi estimate says
- 16 W for main board (based on beaglebone SBC max draw
- Extremely liberal 12 W / Stepper Motor
- Give +40% for margin
#+begin_src octave :results output code
SBC = 16;
SM = 12*8;
MARGIN = 1.4;
fermi_total = MARGIN * (SBC + SM)
#+end_src
#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src octave
fermi_total = 156.80
#+end_src
Tends to run ~$75/unit on Digikey, [[https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/traco-power/TXLN-150-124/13681763][link]]

* Challenges

- Custom hardware at microcontroller level can be tricky
- Winch design likely to involve some interaction with mechanical engineering
- Real time kinematics calculations can be a challenging CS thing, getting to the correct O(n) is critical
- Active position control can be mathematically involved sometimes
- Robotics can be mathematically involved sometimes
- Cable tension problems must be accounted for; for high speed or high robot:object mass ratios



* Vision Applications

If we feel ambitious the clear thing to do in robotics is usually to add a camera + vision daughter board, demonstrate that we can throw and catch items. I have not done vision like this, super speculative.
