* Summary of Accomplishments

Several discussions about project viability:

* Capstone adviser meeting
The team met with Masoud in the ECE capstone lab to discuss project proposals, expectations, and what effort results in a succesful team. Ten ideas were briefly discussed:

1. Airdrop phone case
   - Nixxed on grounds of low complexity
2. Remote Light switch
   - Proposal involved a set of light modules connected and controlled by an IoT protocol, nixxed on grounds of low complexity.
3. Portable arcade cabinet–Alejandro
   - Proposal involved af portable arcade cabinet/console platform with several modular components designed to provide AR experiences to end users.
4. Parallel Robotics–Will
   - Proposal involved design of a cable driven parallel robot, a generic device with broad applications in warehousing, manufacturing, pick-and-place, biological testing, and automation.
5. Garbage-Robotics Assist–Ian
   - Proposal involved design of a 'catcher robot,' with a drive chassis and optical sensor. Team conceived the robot as tracking parabaloids in space using machine vision, and centering itsself under them.
6. wheelchair that sends sms if ekg signals goes out (wheelchair)--Gogo
   - Proposal involved a wheelchair with several integrated biomedical sensors designed to alert relevant caretakers of problems.
7. Active control for a wheelchair that stays upright
   - Proposal involved design of a wheelchair which operates as an inverted pendulum (similar to a Segway). User would control device with abdominal movements. Target market: those with need of a wheelchair and a desire to prevent acute muscular atrophy.
8. Muscle sensors to see what needs working or is chronic (for elderly)(cardio and muscle activity tracker)
   - Proposal involved a number of biomedical sensors used to create a heatmap of individual muscular states.
9. E-Ink Keyboard–Peter
   - Proposal involved creation of a keyboard device with paper-white e-ink keycaps, allowing users to switch alphabets and layouts while maintaining an accurate visualization. Proposed market is multilinguals, superusers with dynamic keybinding needs, and DVORAK afficianados.

* Breakout Meeting + Defense in the Radio Lab
<2022-07-18 Mon 16:00-19:00>

Projects in the above section tagged [ -- NAME ] were selected as roughly viable, and the team decided to move forward with more formal defenses. Gokce was unable to attend due to a medical emergency.

** E-Ink Keyboard

By adding e-ink displays into the keycaps, we can dynamically set the value of the key and display the value on each keycap.  This will allow users who require multiple keyboard layouts to switch quickly and easily, and will no longer be required to memorize multiple layouts.

The value of e-ink displays is the low energy requirements for the screen and the screens do not require continuous power to display text, unlike LCD screens.

*** Market: There are two large groups of users that this keyboard would be designed for:

Bilingual/Polyglot writers : For any customer that regularly types in multiple languages, they often have to rely on brute memorization if they are working on a language that does not have the default QWERTY layout.  For these users, they will be able to switch between these two layouts quickly and easily, and the screens on each keycap will reflect the configuration that the user selects. 

Software power users : Users of applications such as Photoshop, After Effects, and AutoCAD make extensive use of keyboard shortcuts to accelerate their workflow.  For these segments of users, having a keyboard that can reflect the shortcuts on the keyboard itself will be valuable, as it will let users store multiple configurations without requiring to commit all of them to memory.

*** How It might be built :
The EIK would be constructed similarly to a regular keyboard, complete with a case, and key switches. There would be three custom components to design, for example a custom pcb to handle the displays associated with each keycap.  In addition, custom plastic coverings would need to be manufactured to account for the circuitry involved with the screens.
    The keyboard pcb would consist of a keyboard matrix,a circuit lattix of M x N junctions, with each one a keycap.  Pressing the key would complete a circuit, which reading the position would allow us to determine which key was pressed.  Using this, we simply pass it into an array and fetch what key it is mapped to, and send that to the computer.

*** Positives of developing:
Prior art : Thankfully, there is ample material to create keyboards, such as KiCAD libraries for footprints of keyboard components
Solves an actual issue: The ability to display different keys without physically switching them is a boon for both bilingual users, as well as power users who use their keyboard extensively for software they use.
Modular complexity : Being able to construct different types of keyboards, as well as a plethora of premade components, means that this keyboard can be as complex or as simple as required.
Foreseeable problems
*** Cost :
E-ink displays are prohibitively expensive, with preliminary searches costing $~5.80 per display. At the smallest possible keyboard size (50%), there are a minimum of 60 keys, bring the cost to ~350 dollars, which is nearly half the budget.
*** Lead times:
There are very few e-ink manufacturers, and even less so at the sizes that we would like to purchase
*** Impossible to source:
They don’t make them this size. Seriously.  Smallest ones I could find were 0.96”.  However, I found a suitable replacement here: https://uk.farnell.com/midas/mcot048064a1v-wi/display-oled-graphic-tab-48x64/dp/2817906.  Only difference is that it’s OLED and 3mm larger than a standard keycap.

** Parallel Robotics Application
*** Applications

**** Why would you even want to do this?

- Two classes of robots

***** serial (like an arm)

- positioning error is cumumlative
- long, complex chain structures
- rigidity decreases as chain count increases
- joint flexibility dependent on upstream and downstream joints

***** parallel (like a spider)

- each chain relatively short and simple in structure
- resists unnecessary movement
- chain positioning error is average
- off-axis flexibility of joints also affected by other chains
- provides closed-loop stiffness, robot is rigid relative to components
- rigidity increases as chain count increases

**** Who even does this?

Anyone who needs really high precision, has comparably small manipulated objects, and is okay with one location

***** Biomedical people

Just trust me on this one, assaying, test verification, DNA sequencing, all automatable with parallel robotics. Bio people tend not to call it robotics though.

Tricky to buy these guys, they tend to be expensive per unit on Digikey and I'd need to do ~1 day of research into the minimum viable motor

**** Mounts

Mounting on 8020 is super easy, literally like legos

*** Electronics Modules

- small PCBA for actuating whatever is on the effector
- communication is possible by a trailing cable assembly or wireless
  - cable for something requiring significant power
  - wireless for low power application

**** Generic Rotary Encoder

- You can buy these on Digikey
- usually easy to interface them with your custom hardware (SPI/CAN/etc)

**** Generic Stepper Motor Driver

- You can buy these on Digikey
- Piece of hardware that generates and sends signals to our selected stepper motor

**** Main Control Board
handles:
- pathing and kinematics
- calibration (likely by limit switch?)
- rotary encoder info streams
- connection to effector
- any fancy active controls we want to implement (like robotic vision)
probably needs to be specced for running some ROS modules, MSP432 dev boards run $50/piece, beaglebone black SBC, or EMC32 line are also good choices

*** Challenges

- Custom hardware at microcontroller level can be tricky
- Winch design likely to involve some interaction with mechanical engineering
- Real time kinematics calculations can be a challenging CS thing, getting to the correct O(n) is critical
- Active position control can be mathematically involved sometimes
- Robotics can be mathematically involved sometimes
- Cable tension problems must be accounted for; for high speed or high robot:object mass ratios

*** Vision Applications

If we feel ambitious the clear thing to do in robotics is usually to add a camera + vision daughter board, demonstrate that we can throw and catch items. I have not done vision like this, super speculative.


** Trash Bot

Original Ideas
1 - Trash can that detects the trajectory of the flying trash and moves to catch it
2 - Trash can with multiple “plates” on the edge of the lid that can lift and block the flying trash to prevent missing
**idea 2 sounds easier to do than 1, but idea 1 is more interesting and has a higher success rate because it isn’t stationary (allows a wider range to “catch”)

Pros:
- throws is appealing
- being thrown out (office (paper), warehouse (cardboard), etc.)

Cons:
- Powering trash bin can introduce sustainability problem
- Unnecessary robot to have in most cases (placing waste bin next to you)
-  Limited in size
- Isn’t the most ground breaking idea









** Wheelchair Alert System

*** Synopsis
Wheelchair safety has remained a strong innovation topic in the healthcare industry as the number of wheelchair users grows at a rapid rate. In 2016, there were over 3.3 million wheelchair users in the United States alone with 1.825 million of those users aged 65 or above. With this strong number of elderly wheelchair users, the probability of wheelchair prone injuries increases. Out of all wheelchair injuries, wheelchair tips and falls lead as one of the highest cases as a study in 2003 found that tips and falls accounted for approximately 65-80% of all wheelchair related injuries. Additionally, as increased innovation is made towards furthering wheelchair user independence in society, the likelihood of wheelchair users living alone is expected to rise. There is a robust financial case to make our wheelchair safety system a viable business. There are no intelligent wheelchair systems available, despite the large market. Senior citizens with limited mobility are also often unable to live autonomously. Living under constant care in a nursing home or a relative while performing simple chores becomes difficult. Currently, no solution alerts caregivers and close contacts when an individual who uses a wheelchair tips and falls. The market has a few similar ideas, but there have been none that have exited the design phase.

*** Pros and Description
This project will be focused on developing a smart wheelchair system capable of reading both wheelchair motion and user heart rate in real-time to detect when wheelchair falls have occurred. Using the live data, an alert is immediately sent to caretakers or loved ones through SMS or an app alert when a wheelchair fall has been detected, allowing for prompt and possibly life-saving care for the wheelchair user. Based on this main hypothesis, the following objectives for this project are formulated: a.) to detect when a wheelchair/user falls in either left, right, forward, or backward direction; b.) monitor heart rate of user; c.) provide immediate communication of fall to caretaker/loved one. Potentially an app could be created to keep all the heart rate data recorded for future use and a notification would be sent to the caretakers or loved ones in case of a fall. The goal of our heart rate monitoring objective is to provide caretakers and doctors with more patient data to allow for a thorough analysis post-fall of a patient’s medical health. This feature is also especially beneficial for those with heart disease and special reduced mobility.

*** Cons
The biggest issue with this project would be novelty as our professor mentioned. There were many projects made in the previous semesters using a wheelchair which could potentially make this idea rather “simple”. We might need to add more features to make it more complex (eg. Active control to stay upright, airbags etc). Signal processing for the ECG data might take longer to perfect by trial and error, that might be why it might be better to analyze ECG data on MATLAB before writing code in another language.

For this design, we can use the 3-Axis ADXL335 Accelerometer which costs between $14.95-16.50 and connect it to an Arduino. For the ECG component we can either use the SparkFun Single Lead Heart Rate Monitor AD8232 ($21.50) or build the ECG on a breadboard using low pass and high pass filters and an amplifier and connect it to an Arduino. Building an ECG on a breadboard will cost around $100.

The design will first start the calibration by connecting to the Arduino board and start data acquisition for a few seconds to calculate the threshold and alert levels. After the calibration is completed live data tracking with alerts will be enabled and the program will check for breaches of alert levels. When the collected data Is above or below a certain threshold, alerts will be triggered, and a notification is sent.

*** Paths to Market
There are numerous paths to market for this design; these include selling the intelligent wheelchair safety system directly to the patients and their families, selling to hospitals, and selling to assisted living homes. The unique selling proposition for this product is its intelligence - by automatically detecting and reporting a tip or fall to the user’s close contact and healthcare provider, pertinent data is relayed almost immediately, and the user can receive assistance faster. These scenarios often occur when the user is too injured or disoriented to contact their loved ones for help. The healthcare provider can also stream ECG data from the time of the accident to view heart rate information, adding additional information that may be pertinent when assisting an individual. After reading numerous case studies and reports, an appropriate business model is identified, which considers a gap in the market, addressed via this innovative solution.

*** Increasing Complexity
- Active control for a wheelchair to stay upright (would not need fall detection)
- A device to help stand up from a wheelchair
- EMG sensors to measure muscle response (could be useful for users who have limited muscle activity to see the response to the nerve’s stimulation of the muscle)
